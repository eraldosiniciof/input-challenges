# Challenges of [codar.me](https://codar.me/) course

Started project with CRA for practice React base concepts

# General infos

- Project with `editorconfig` and `eslint` for follow default config for all files
- Components make with `Styled Components`
- I'm repeating some codes intentionally for practice. In fthe future I can refactor to abstract some things

# For local execution:

1. Clone this repository
2. Install needed dependencies: `yarn`
3. Start project: `yarn start`
